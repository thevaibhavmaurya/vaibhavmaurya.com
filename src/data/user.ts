  about: `
Hello, 👋  
I'm Vaibhav Maurya. I enjoy learning things deeply, writing clean code, and building systems that scale with clarity.

I care about understanding problems at their core and designing solutions that remain simple over time. System design, clean abstractions, and thoughtful engineering matter a lot to me. Curiosity drives my work, and I'm always exploring new ideas and technologies to grow as an engineer.

I also enjoy writing to reflect on what I learn and share my thoughts along the way.

You can follow me on Dev.to to read my blogs and learnings:
